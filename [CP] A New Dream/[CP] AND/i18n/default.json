It's the main island of the three Arcanian isles.$1#$b#See we call each island something different and then Arcania is the surname to those islands.$1#$b#Arcanian's view the islands as their own people, with thoughts and feelings.

Their aggressive temperament and picky diet have led to an increase in popularity of true goats over them, however, leading to concerns over their conservation status.",

These tribes left their homeland during the early Stone Age and ventured towards a new, untouched group of islands.^They were the first to settle there and named the three land masses Arcania after their tribe's namesake. This marked the beginning of their colonization efforts in these unexplored lands. However, tensions arose among them, stemming solely from matters of faith. Different families worshiped different goddesses, leading to an inevitable dispute over which deity to worship.^This disagreement over theology caused the people of Arcania to split into three separate tribes, each relocating to different islands. Ruual, to the west, became home to worshippers of Lipheum. Suuwe, to the east, welcomed followers of Arah. Tuuwe, which is situated between Ruual and Suuwe, honored both goddesses. Surprisingly, Tuuwe quickly became a hub of peace and trade among the tribes.^For centuries, the Suuwe and Rual peoples lived apart. But as the population of Arcania declined and dangerous animals and weather threatened their safety, they had to come together. They reunited on the island of Tuuwe to face these challenges as one group. Today, the people of Arcania still live together on this island, showing that unity brings peace amid chaos.",
